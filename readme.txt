I'm looking to enhance my game with a new user referral page. Each player will have a unique referral link. When a new user logs in using this link, the referring player will earn 500 points and the new user will appear on their friends page in the game. All relevant data will be stored in a MySQL database.
The game is in the programming environment Construct 3.

The key features of this project include:
- A friends page displaying a list of the player's friends with their respective referral links.
- Automatic crediting of points (500) upon a successful referral, with the possibility of future tasks involved.
- Completion of this project is required within a month.

Ideal candidates for this project should have:
- Extensive experience with game development, particularly with Construct 2 or similar platforms.
- Proficiency in MySQL for data storage and retrieval.
- A good understanding of user interface design to create a seamless and engaging friends page.
- Ability to complete the project within the specified timeframe.


I wanna make a project using php and mysql. First page is signup page which doesn't involve email input. When I input all data in signup page, the user have 0 coin and its own http link. When the link is input in google url box, it will go to clicked user's friend page. and all data including coin and link information must save in database and if there is a same email user, it will release error notification message. When the signup processed successfully, it must go to the login page.  When user input all data in login page, it must compared with database data. If input data is not correct, it will release error notification message. When login access successed, it will go to the userlist page. In userlist page, there will be a list of user with all data of user including coin information.  
And when I click the user name, that clicked user coin must increase by 500 and I will be a friend with him. And when I clicked the user name to increase his coin, I can't clicked his name anymore. It all must be added in database. And finally it must go to the friends page. In friends page, there are list of my friends. But keep in mind. My friend's friend is also my friend. In other words, in my friend page, there will be all my friends connected directly and indirectly.
that's all. Give me code with wonderful UI.
